It combines blockchain technology with a Streamlit user interface and has been designed to simplify the user experience as much as possible, whilst ensuring a robust , transparent and effective system.

------------------------------------------
**Technologies used**

- Solidity: used to create the smart contract and execute the blockchain transactions
- Remix IDE: enabled the compiling and editing of the Solidity code and the is the application where the code is run
- OpenZepplin: library for ERC20 conrtacts
- Ganache: to provide pre funded etherum accounts and transactions
- Web3: to deploy the blockchain contract
- Streamlit: enable an application in a web browser to provide interaction with the ledger, or simply put - to create a user friendly interface and run the voting process
- Python: coding environment for the pages of the Streamlit application
- Visual Studio: coding envirnment for Streamlit application
- Metamask: as the wallet environment to interact with Ganache

To see all libraries and dependencies please refer to individual working files in the above folders.

-------------------------------------------
**Solution Overview**
1. Install Metamask and create an account
2. Install the Ganache Truffle Suite on your desktop
3. Open Remix IDE and open the election.sol file
4. Compile and run the process
5. Deploy the contract in in the 'injected Web3' environment
6. Update the Env and python files wallet address and Web3.HTTPProvider to your specific needs
7. Launch terminal and open the voting.py and Election_Home.py files in the folders above in the Streamlit application
